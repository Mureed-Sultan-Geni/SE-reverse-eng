    <h2>Templates</h2>
    <p>Templates are pure HTML and allow string interpolation and enhancement via data-* attributes.</p>

    <h3>String Interpolation</h3>
    <p>You can interpolate data in template using the <em>{variable_name}</em> notation. It can access fields from component or global data. All global data made available to the templates will start with a ‘@’ sign.</p>
    <p>Note that string interpolation is done before the component is created and it does not update afterwards if/when the data changes.</p>

    <pre><code class="code-block js">var compData = {person: {name: "something"}, things: [{id: 1}]};
var comp = getComp(‘template_name’, compData);</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="code-block html"><div>Name is {person.name}. Id is {things.0.id}</div></code></pre>

    <h3>data-name</h3>
    <p>Stores a jQuery object wrapping the element in the created component using this key, prefixed by "$". <em>$root</em> is always stored, so "root" should not be used as value of <em>data-name</em>.</p>

    <h3>data-val</h3>
    <p>Sets the <em>val</em> attribute of the DOM element using interpolation.</p>

    <h3>data-src</h3>
    <p>Sets the <em>src</em> attribute of the DOM element using interpolation</p>

    <h3>data-href</h3>
    <p>Used for internal links of the SPA. SetJS will create the <em>href</em> attribute and prevent reloading of the application. On click, the new page will be opened</p>

    <h3>data-bind & data-watch</h3>
    <p>Used to provide a simple way to dynamically control the UI (including content rendering). <em>data-watch</em> is used on existing properties and runs the binding automatically when the field is changed. It uses Object.defineProperty() to start observing changes. <em>data-watch</em> should be used only where it makes absolute sense to automatically update UI based on data changes. Most of the times you should use data-bind. SetJS does not encourage gloabl use of this behavior as common in other frameworks.</p>
    <p>Let’s suppose you pass the following data to a component (2nd argument to the getComp call):</p>
    <pre><code class="code-block js">var compData = {amount: 10, user: {name: "some name"}};
var comp  = getComp(template_name, compData);

// You can use the above through data-bind:

&lt;div data-bind="user.name"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-bind="amount"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The data-bind string uses a very simple mini-language. A few characters i.e. <em>;</em>, <em>:</em>, <em>|</em>, <em>,</em>, <em>`</em> and <em>~</em> have special meaning as given below:</p>

    <h5>Colon ( : )</h5>
    <p>The first part of each statement is a value. If you want more than 1 binding making use of the same value, you can separate them using the <em>:</em> character. E.g:</p>
    <pre><code class="code-block html">&lt;span data-bind="type:text:addClass"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Two jQuery functions i.e. <em>text</em> and <em>addClass</em> are called and the value of <em>type</em> is passed to each as a parameter.</p>

    <h5>Pipe ( | )</h5>
    <p>You can create a series of function calls to work on a value using the <em>|</em> character. E.g:</p>
    <pre><code class="code-block html">&lt;span data-bind="person.type|isAdmin|toggle"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The value of <em>person.type</em> is first passed to a function <em>isAdmin</em> (defined in the component data or as a global function) and the result is then passed to another jQuery function, <em>toggle</em></p>

    <h5>Comma ( , )</h5>
    <p>You can pass parameters to the functions using comma as a separator. E.g:</p>
    <pre><code class="code-block html">&lt;input data-bind="val:equal,Admin|toggleClass,is-admin"/&gt;</code></pre>
    <p><em>val</em> is first checked to be equal to "Admin". The result is used by <em>toggleClass</em> to toggle the "is-admin" class.</p>

    <h5>Semicolon ( ; )</h5>
    <p>Separates statements. A data-bind command consists of one or more statements. In most cases, you’ll be using a single statement and will not use the <em>;</em> character. If you need more than 1 statement in a data-bind attribute, you’ll use semicolon to separate your statements. Each statement in turn will consist of one value and one or more bindings making use of that value.</p>

    <h5>Prime ( ` )</h5>
    <p>If you want the provided value to be parsed as a literal string, you can enclose it with <em>`</em> characters. That way you can use special characters in it. Also, the value passed will not be interpreted as a variable path.</p>

    <h5>Tilde ( ~ )</h5>
    <p>Prefix a property path with <em>~</em> so that it is evaluated each time the binding is performed i.e. initially as well as when you call the component’s update method.</p>

    <h3>data-func & data-arg</h3>
    <p>Used by <em>data-act</em>, detailed next</p>

    <h3>data-act:</h3>
    <p>Used to bind events. Can be accompanied by data-func to specify the name of the function that is to be called when the event is raised. If data-func is not provided, SetJS will try to call a function with the same name as the event. A few abbreviations are provided by default:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>down = mousedown touchstart</li>
      <li>up = mouseup touchend</li>
      <li>out = mouseleave touchleave touchcancel</li>
      <li>move = mousemove touchmove</li>
      <li>form = submit *</li>
    </ul>
    <p>* <em>form</em> enables special handling of the "submit" event via the handleEvent function of your application in <em>src/scripts/core/setjs-init.js</em>.</p>

    <h3>data-if, data-elif and data-else</h3>
    <p>One time conditional rendering of content. Only evaluated when the component is created. The respective DOM element is either kept or removed based on the result. The first two (data-if, data-elif) expect similar syntax as data-bind. The statement separator (the semicolon) works as AND and the binding separator (the colon) works as OR. It is recommended to not let these conditions become too complex for better readability. If a complex condition is needed, you can move it to the code as function call and call that function from these attributes. Remember that setjs tries to keep templates simple. Any complex logic should be handled in code.</p>

    <h3>data-list and data-slot</h3>
    <p>data-list allows creation of lists. data-slot allows reuse of a template within other templates. Both accept a JSON string with the following keys:</p>

    <h5>prop</h5>
    <p>(Optional if <em>func</em> (below) is provided). Name/Key of the property that will be used. Can be a function name that in turn provides the data. In the case of data-slot, if neither <em>prop</em> nor <em>func</em> is given, the parent data will be used as the data of the child component.</p>

    <h5>func</h5>
    <p>(Optional) A function to be called after prop gives the data. If prop is not given, the root data will be passed to <em>func</em>. Mostly used to filter or modify the data before the slot or list are rendered.</p>

    <h5>name</h5>
    <p>(Optional) If provided, the list object or the slot component created by SetJS will be stored in the created component using this key.</p>

    <h5>vars</h5>
    <p>(Optional) Used to optionally rename keys of values provided to child component:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>k: Rename default key "key"</li>
      <li>v: Rename default key "val"</li>
      <li>d: Rename default key "dex"</li>
      <li>i: Rename default key "index"</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>subs</h5>
    <p>(Optional) A key/value map to be used to replace literal text. The values will replace the matching keys.</p>
